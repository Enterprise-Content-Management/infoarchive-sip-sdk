=== Added

- Added entries filter to `YamlMap.sort()` to exclude entries from being sorted.



== 8.0.0 - 2017-09-20

=== Changed

- `YamlMap.sort(boolean)` performs a non-recursive sort when given `false`. This is the exact opposite of the 
  previous behavior of sorting everything but the top level. This new approach allows complete control over sorting
  (using a visitor), where some objects can be sorted and others left alone, or different objects can be sorted with
  different comparators.
