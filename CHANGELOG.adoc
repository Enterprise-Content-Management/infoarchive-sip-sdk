- Support additional binary formats during YAML normalization: `custom`, `pdf`


=== Fixed

- Some fixes in `ZipConfiguration` (which now uses the new `ZipBuilder`)



== 9.16.0

WARNING: Version 9.16.0 violated semantic versioning and should have been 10.0.0.




== 9.15.0 - 2018-03-19

=== Added

- Added support for binary resources in YAML: during normalization these are not inlined. Use `binary: true` to 
indicate a binary resource, or use a `format` or file extension that is considered binary. For now, only `zip` is 
supported



== 9.14.1 - 2018-03-14

=== Fixed

- During YAML normalization, pattern matching with wildcards now correctly handles characters with special meaning in
regular expressions



== 9.14.0 - 2018-03-13

=== Added

- YAML normalization now supports inlining multiple resources based on a pattern; see `ResourcesResolver` 


=== Fixed

- During YAML normalization, the default value will be used if a property has an empty value in a `.properties` file
- When inlining YAML files, YAML normalization merges items of the same type instead of throwing an exception
- When serializing a `YamlMap` to string, text values that start with `*` are now properly quoted

=== Added

- Configuration builders now support content objects



== 9.12.0 - 2018-02-19

=== Added

- YAML configuration `includes` can now be skipped by making it an object and adding `configure: ignore`. This 
makes it possible to conditionally include a file using a property. The object should should have a key `resource`,
the value of which is the resource to include.

=== Fixed

- `ZipConfiguration.of(file)` threw a `NullPointerException` when `file` was a simple file without path, like
  `new File("configuration.yml")`.



== 9.11.3 - 2018-02-09

=== Fixed

- `ArchiveClient.query()` is now deprecated, since searching by AIC will be deprecated in the server starting with 
16EP4. This method will be removed in version 10 of the SDK.

  (using a visitor), where some objects can be sorted and others left alone, or different objects can be sorted with
  different comparators.
